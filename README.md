## Summary

This is an analysis of the generic malware app4444 with the hash 240387329dee4f03f98a89a2feff9bf30dcba61fcf614cdac24129da54442762

App4444 does not have many identifying features, and I do not know which malware family this comes from in particular. Online analysis identifies it as many things, primarily the Johnnie family as well as the Zusy family, however I do not think it properly belongs to either of these families. Due to its lack of identifying features, and lack of family that I know of, and a lack of a name already, I am calling it app4444, a reference to both its behavior and a string found within it. The behavior is particularly benign, and it has no persistence or any sort of traversal. As shown in the behavior section below, its tasks are minimal. It also contains no obfuscation techniques.

## Behavior

1. App4444 will check if a process in memory named `svchostx64.exe` exists, then terminate the process.
2. App4444 will check if `%appdata%\Roaming\svchostx64.exe` exists, and if so, will delete it. 
3. App4444 will then proceed to check and terminate the processes `winupdsrvc.exe`, `wincfg.exe`, `wincfg32.exe`, `winupd.exe` and `winupd32.exe`
4. Then it terminates

## Indicators of Compromise

Though the impact of app4444 is extremely minimal, and its chance of infecting a system is just as minimal, indicators of compromise include its killing of system processes, as explained in the behavior section. It does not modify the system much further than this.

## Analysis

App4444 appears to only minimally affect a system, and in particular it seems to target a previous malware's infection with its deletion of a file in appdata. App4444 is not very dangerous, novel, or notable. However, for any future researcher, these are my findings.
