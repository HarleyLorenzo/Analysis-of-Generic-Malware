This is an analysis of the generic malware sample 240387329dee4f03f98a89a2feff9bf30dcba61fcf614cdac24129da54442762

Researcher: Harley A.W. Lorenzo

This malware does not have many identifying features, and I do not know which malware family this comes from in particular. Online analysis identifies it as many things, primarily the Johnnie family as well as the Zusy family, however I do not think it properly belongs to either of these families. The behavior is particularly benign, and it has no persistence or any sort of traversal. As shown in the behavior section below, its tasks are minimal. It also contains no obfuscation techniques.

## Behavior

The malware will check if a process in memory named svchostx64.exe exists, then terminate the process.

The malware will check if `%appdata%\Roaming\svchostx64.exe` exists, and if so, will delete it. 

The malware will then proceed to check and terminate the processes `winupdsrvc.exe`, `wincfg.exe`, `wincfg32.exe`, `winupd.exe` and `winupd32.exe`

After this, the malware will then terminate.

## Indicators of Compromise

Though the impact of this malware is extremely minimal, and its chance of infecting a system is just as minimal, indicators of compromise include its killing of system processes, as explained in the behavior section. It does not modify the system much further than this.

## Analysis

This malware appears to only minimally affect a system, and in particular it seems to target a previous malware's infection with its deletion of a file in appdata. This malware is not very dangerous, novel, or notable. However, for any future researcher, these are my findings.
